## Introduction
This technical document was created as a project in the Free Code Camp 'Responsive Web Developer Certification'.
In the process, instead of focusing on the content, I wanted to instead focus on smooth functionality and design.

## Process
- I created a mock up in Figma for how I wanted the document to be created as a base on where to start. I also wanted to include a scroll spy, being a sticking position and to allow the user to scroll to different areas in the technical document.

## Technologies
- Figma for the mock up
- Font Awesome for the Logo
- Bootstrap for Scroll Spy and some CSS classes (ie. padding/margin)
- Google Font

## Launch
- Launched it to the Github pages for public view via the following URL: https://naomijustin.github.io/technical-document-fcc/
